# axgdiscobot
Discord Bot built to provide support to streamers on our community server.  
If you are looking for a bot to run on your own server there are plenty of better options. 
This is more of an educational project so all implementations might not work outside the AXG server. Work in Progress


I wil try to list used repos here for ease of access, otherwise they can be found in the code.

Javacord -  Library for managing discord.  Great way to learn good design patterns, and it has an awesome community. https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord

sdcf4j  -  CommandHandler which works well with javacord: https://github.com/Bastian/sdcf4j
